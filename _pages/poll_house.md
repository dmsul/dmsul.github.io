**Abstract**\\
In this paper, I present evidence that current economics research significantly
  underestimates the effects of air pollution.
This bias exists because a polluter's effect on nearby residents changes
  dramatically with the direction of the wind, and most popular methods,
  including geographic diff-in-diffs and monitor-based interpolations, are
  unable to account for such sharp changes in exposure over short distances.
To solve this problem, I use an atmospheric dispersion model, which explicitly
  accounts for meteorological conditions, to determine the effect of every
  polluting firm on every house in metropolitan Los Angeles.
I then estimate the effect of NOx emissions on house prices using the
  exogenous variation in emissions caused by the California Electricity Crisis
  of 2000 and a cap-and-trade program in greater Los Angeles.
The estimated price response is much larger than past estimates and implies that
  the net social value of the cap-and-trade program is roughly $502 million
  per year.
However, when based on conventional measures of pollution exposure, this
  estimated valuation is small and statistically indistinguishable from zero.
