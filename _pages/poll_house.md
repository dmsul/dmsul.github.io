**Abstract**\\
This paper presents evidence that current research significantly underestimates
  the effects of air pollution because conventional methods cannot account for
  sharp changes in pollution over short distances or the wind-driven dispersion
  of pollutants.
I use a state-of-the-art atmospheric dispersion model, which solves
  these problems, with a natural experiment to estimate the causal effect of
  NOx exposure on house prices in metropolitan Los Angeles.
The wind-based estimate is over 10 times larger than conventional estimates and
  implies the value of RECLAIM, the local cap-and-trade program underlying the
  natural experiment, is roughly $502 million per year.
