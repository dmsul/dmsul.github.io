**Abstract**\\
This paper presents evidence that current research significantly underestimates
  the effects of air pollution.
Conventional methods of measuring pollution exposure cannot account for sharp
  changes in pollution over short distances or the wind-driven dispersion of
  pollutants.
I use a state-of-the-art atmospheric dispersion model, which solves
  these problems, with a natural experiment to estimate the causal effect of
  NOx exposure on house prices in metropolitan Los Angeles.
The wind-based estimates are over 10 times larger than conventional estimates and
  imply that the net social benefit of RECLAIM, the local cap-and-trade program
  underlying the natural experiment, is roughly $500 million per year.
