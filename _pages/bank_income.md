There is ongoing interest in determining what predicts that a person will file
bankruptcy. Past research has pointed to both a variety of acute shocks
immediately before filing and the presence of substantial debt as risk factors
for filing bankruptcy. We provide evidence on both fronts by using the PSID
sample of bankruptcy filers to look at income, consumption, and asset decisions
in the decade before filing. We show that the acute income shocks faced by the
bankrupt are only slightly worse than those of a demographically comparable set
of non-bankrupt. On the other hand, while most households have rising income
and consumption over the life cycle, the bankrupt start at a point similar to
their peers but have stagnant income in the decade before filing. Over the same
period their consumption continues to match that of their peers. The high
levels of debt observed at the time of filing are thus likely the result of
below average income growth coupled with average consumption growth.
