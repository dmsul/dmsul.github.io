**Abstract**\\
Consumers often rely on lawyers to make complicated legal decisions, though in
many cases the lawyer's financial interests are at odds with those of the
client. We consider this general problem in the context of consumers filing for
bankruptcy. Lawyers advise debtors on whether to file the cheaper Chapter 7
filing or the more expensive Chapter 13 filing. Bankruptcy courts that allow
lawyers to charge more for Chapter 13 bankruptcy see a significantly larger
fraction of Chapter 13 filings (elasticity of 0.3). This is true controlling
for a host of demographic controls at the zip code level, as well as with state
fixed effects and district policy controls. Our estimates suggest that 5.4% of
cross-district variation in relative Chapter 13 rates could be eliminated by
harmonizing relative fees.
