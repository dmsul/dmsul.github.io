**Abstract**\\
While the costs of environmental policies are generally thought to be
  regressive, the distribution of benefits is less understood.
This paper estimates the change in rents and neighborhood demographics in
  metropolitan Los Angeles caused by the California Electricity Crisis of 2000
  which unexpectedly and permanently lowered air pollution in certain
  neighborhoods.
I measure local exposure to this pollution shock using a dispersion model
  developed by atmospheric scientists which tracks the effects individual firms
  have on the air quality at arbitrary locations.
The estimates show that (a) housing rents increase as much as housing prices;
  (b) 9% of low-income households leave the sample area due to improved air
  quality; and (c) low-income households are rarely home owners who would benefit
  from increased housing wealth.
I show that a standard residential sorting model predicts that when low-income
  residents respond to improved amenities by leaving, the distribution of
  benefits from the improvement is likely regressive.
Together, these results suggest that the distribution of benefits from improved
  air quality likely favors higher-income households.
